Code to accompany Persistence Norms and the Datasaurus

We make use of the datasauRus package in R and relate to the paper by Matejka and Fitzmaurice (2017). Please remember to cite both the datasauRus package and the Matejka and Fitzmaurice paper if using this code.

There are two files to recreate the paper:
  Firstly, there is a Datasaurus R code which produces the majority of the paper. 
  Secondly, the file Datasaurus Experiments.txt produces the dataset transformations in Section 5.1. Please note that the experiments take a long time to complete and are only advised to be attempted if absolutely necessary.
